[About]
While the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEJL2Uuv-oQ">I'm just a Bill</a> view of the legislative process is a great overview  of the legislative process, tracking the status of a bill (Bill Introduced, in committee, on floor, conference committee, etc) is just the tip of the iceberg of understanding the legislative process. Several other important data exists that serve as indicators of a bills true status, the most obvious of which are research documents surrounding a piece of legislation.  While most of these documents are made available to the public by the agencies and offices that author them, there is very little standardization in how they are distributed.  docserver is a legislative document archive and aggregator that collects research surrounding legislation and makes them available programmatically via API.
